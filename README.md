# Table3-DevNet-Project4

# This project contains a variety of simple Ansible playbooks meant to do basic network configurations and operations. The first playbook can ping the demonstrating switch and router to show connectivity. 
# The second playbook can install basic SSH and hostname configurations. The third playbook can create VLANs to show remote management and configuration. The fourth creates backups from the running-config.
# These playbooks show introductory and basic knowledge about Anisble and its use within network management.
